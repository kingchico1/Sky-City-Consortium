# Sky City Consortium 🌐🏙️

An open-source blueprint for a stratospheric aerial civilization. Inspired by Laputa, O'Neill cylinders, and post-nation ideals, this project explores hybrid buoyancy tech, AI governance, CNT materials, and modular vertical zones — aiming to prototype 1km-scale floating habitats.

## 🚀 Vision
- Solve Earth overcrowding via stratospheric habitats
- Merge lunar He-3, ion thrusters, and hybrid buoyancy
- Post-nation, merit-based, decentralized governance
- Collaboratively built, open-source, and ethically rooted

## 🧱 Repo Structure
