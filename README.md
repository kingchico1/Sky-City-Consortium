# Sky City Consortium 🌐🏙️

**An open-source blueprint for a stratospheric aerial civilization.**  
Inspired by Laputa, O'Neill cylinders, and post-nation ideals, this project explores hybrid buoyancy tech, AI governance, CNT materials, and modular vertical zones — aiming to prototype 1km-scale floating habitats.

---

## 🚀 Vision

- Solve Earth’s overcrowding by expanding human civilization into the stratosphere  
- Use hybrid buoyancy via heated air, lunar He-3, and ion thrusters for stabilization  
- Establish a decentralized, post-nation governance model based on merit and stewardship  
- Promote ethical, collaborative design and open-source development for planetary-scale innovation

## 🧱 Repo Structure

This repository is organized into modular folders to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration:

/designs/           → Platform sketches, structural concepts, zone layouts  
/materials/         → CNT, aerogel, graphene notes and research  
/energy/            → Power sources including He-3, solar, and ion systems  
/buoyancy/          → Hybrid lift models and buoyancy equations  
/governance/        → Post-nation ideas, meritocratic frameworks  
/docs/              → References, citations, academic sources  
/simulations/       → Python/Matplotlib models for energy, lift, etc.  
/assets/            → Visuals, renders, and concept illustrations

## 🔧 How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo  
2. Add value (e.g. a design idea, calculation, ethical model)  
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) or Issue  
4. Start a discussion in any folder’s markdown  
5. Credit will be tracked for all major contributions

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project draws from:

- Laputa (Ghibli) — symbolic floating autonomy  
- O'Neill Cylinders — space habitats as freedom frontiers  
- Seasteading — but in the skies  
- Post-nation governance — less borders, more merit

## 💬 Join the Consortium

We’re looking for:

- Engineers (aerospace, propulsion, structural)  
- Materials scientists (CNT, graphene, aerogels)  
- Ethicists & futurists (post-nation governance)  
- Simulation experts (Python, physics modeling)  
- Visualizers and designers
