# Hybrid Buoyancy System – Sky City Lift Strategy

Sky City platforms will float at altitudes between 20–50 km using a hybrid lift system combining **heated air**, **helium/hydrogen**, and **magnetically stabilized CNT tethers**. This mix allows sustained altitude, load flexibility, and redundancy.

## 🌐 1. Base Buoyancy: Heated Air + Helium/Hydrogen

| Gas Type | Lifting Power | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Heated Air | Medium | Safer, variable via solar |
| Helium | Low | Non-flammable, expensive |
| Hydrogen | High | Flammable, lightweight, abundant on Moon (He-3 mining by-product) |

- **Primary Structure**: Modular lift cells lined with heat-insulating CNT panels
- **Solar-heated Air Chambers** for altitude fine-tuning
- **He/H₂ Bladders** for passive baseline lift

## ⚙️ 2. Dynamic Stabilization: Ion Thrusters

- Mounted at cardinal nodes for yaw, pitch, roll control
- Powered via solar arrays and supercapacitors
- Used during:
  - Wind shear compensation
  - Load redistribution
  - Docking maneuvers

## 🧠 3. AI-Controlled Altitude Logic

- Altitude control algorithm uses:
  - Internal temperature sensors (lift chamber control)
  - External pressure feedback
  - Weather pattern prediction
- Adjusts ballast release, heat input, and gas balancing dynamically

## 🧲 4. Experimental: Magnetic Tether Anchors

- Option: Extend CNT tethers to Earth-sea anchors or drones
- Magnetically stabilized for emergency retraction
- Useful for cargo delivery, station-keeping

---

## 🧪 Research Areas Needed

- Wind shear impact on large stratospheric structures
- Electrolysis of water vapor for hydrogen top-up
- Fire suppression systems for hybrid gas cells
- Autonomous control of distributed buoyancy nodes
