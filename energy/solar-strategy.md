# Solar Energy Strategy for Sky City

Sky City will rely on a multi-layered solar capture and storage system, designed to function continuously in the upper stratosphere where solar exposure is optimal (~90%+ irradiance vs. surface).

## ☀️ Solar Environment at 20–50 km Altitude

- **Solar Irradiance**: ~1,350 W/m² (above cloud interference)
- **Air Density**: Thin, but sufficient for thermal exchange
- **Challenges**: Ice crystal deposition, UV degradation, and orientation shifts

---

## 🧩 Strategy Overview

### 1. **Surface-Integrated Solar Panels**
- Ultra-thin CNT-based photovoltaic membranes embedded into panel skins
- Flexible, durable under atmospheric strain

### 2. **Vertical Solar Petals**
- Foldable, rotating panels that track sunlight
- Double as thermal radiators during night cycles

### 3. **High-Altitude Solar Mirrors**
- Suspended reflectors to redirect and intensify sunlight on demand
- Mounted on drones tethered to central nodes

---

## 🔋 Energy Storage

### Primary:
- **Solid-State Batteries** (embedded within platform modules)
  - Long cycle life, thermal-safe, modular
- **CNT-Supercapacitors**
  - Rapid discharge for stabilization systems (e.g., ion thrusters)

### Backup:
- **Hydrogen Fuel Cells**
  - Fed via electrolysis using solar excess
  - Also used in emergency propulsion

## 🚀 Power Distribution Grid

- Smart decentralized microgrids
- Embedded CNT conductors in platform floors and panels
- Self-healing network rerouting using AI prediction

---

## ⚠️ Energy Use Priorities

1. Life support and habitats
2. Platform stabilization (ion thrusters, ballast pumps)
3. Vertical farming zones
4. Navigation systems and external comms

---

## 🔧 Research Needs

- Panel degradation simulation under UV-C and high-altitude particles
- Lightweight high-efficiency battery designs
- Solar petal actuation using piezoelectric motors

---

## 🤝 Call for Contributions

- Add solar orientation tracking models
- Propose energy budgeting system (e.g., per-module consumption)
