# Energy Systems of Sky City – Sustaining a Stratospheric Civilization

Sky City floats 10–50 km above Earth. At that altitude, traditional power grids don’t work. We need scalable, sustainable, and **distributed** energy systems designed for:

- Minimal mass
- Long-term autonomy
- No reliance on ground infrastructure

---

## ☀️ 1. Primary Sources

### Solar Power
- Continuous solar exposure above clouds = high output
- Ultralight PV panels integrated into platform skin (CNT-graphene composite)
- Rotating solar arrays for directional optimization

### Lunar Helium-3 (He-3)
- Long-term vision: fusion reactors powered by He-3 from the Moon
- Requires future mining missions + return logistics
- Ideal due to:
  - Low radiation byproducts
  - High energy yield per gram

---

## 🔋 2. Storage Systems

### Supercapacitors
- CNT-based graphene ultracapacitors
- Fast charge/discharge cycles
- Minimal degradation over time

### Lightweight Batteries
- Solid-state lithium-air or sodium-ion
- Integrated into load-bearing structures

---

## 🧠 3. Smart Distribution

- Energy routed via mesh-grid systems across modules
- AI monitors:
  - Load balancing
  - Priority rerouting (e.g., life support > entertainment)
  - Solar degradation prediction

---

## 🌀 4. Redundancy & Resilience

- Redundant solar banks per module
- Emergency kinetic flywheels
- Manual override in case of AI or system failure
- Fire suppression & vacuum-isolated modules

## 🌕 5. Lunar He-3 Roadmap (Visionary Track)

| Phase | Year | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| Phase 1 | 2025–2027 | Simulation of He-3 reactor models |
| Phase 2 | 2028–2032 | Partnerships for lunar regolith study |
| Phase 3 | 2033–2035 | Prototype He-3 capture + return |
| Phase 4 | 2036–2040 | Sky City Reactor v1 powered by He-3
