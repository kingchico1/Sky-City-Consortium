# Solar-Boosted Ion Thrusters for Sky City Stabilization

To maintain positioning at 10–50 km altitude, Sky City requires efficient and silent stabilization tech. Ion thrusters powered by solar arrays are a leading candidate.

## ⚙️ Core Concept

- Use **high-efficiency solar panels** to charge onboard capacitor banks.
- Route energy to **ion propulsion units** to control lateral drift and elevation.
- Operate in low-density stratosphere with **xenon or argon** propellant.

## 🔋 Solar Array Strategy

| Type               | Efficiency (%) | Use Case                            |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multi-junction     | 32–36%         | Main dome surface, highest yield    |
| Perovskite-CNT     | ~25%           | Flexible edge arrays, experimental  |
| Thin-film flexible | ~20%           | Lightweight expansion modules       |
