# Lunar Helium-3 (He-3) as a Strategic Energy Source

This document explores the use of Helium-3 (He-3) extracted from the lunar surface as a clean, lightweight fuel source for Sky City propulsion, energy stability, and long-term sustainability.

## 🌑 Why He-3?

- **Abundant on the Moon** — Solar winds embed He-3 into lunar regolith over billions of years.
- **Aneutronic Fusion** — He-3 fusion (e.g., D–He3 reactions) offers minimal radiation risk, safer than traditional nuclear options.
- **Lightweight & Energy-Dense** — Ideal for airborne platforms where every kilogram matters.

## 🚀 Energy Applications in Sky City

- **Main Propulsion** — Powering ion or hybrid-electric thrusters for station-keeping and altitude adjustments
- **Thermal Management** — Fusion waste heat repurposed for zoned heating or steam-based circulation
- **Backup Systems** — He-3 can be used in compact reserve modules for emergency floatation

---

## 🔁 Earth-Moon Supply Chain (Future Outlook)

- **Lunar Mining Stations** — Possible by 2040 via joint ventures with space agencies or private launch firms
- **Orbital Refueling Depots** — Mid-transfer tanks for Sky City to receive He-3 mid-atmosphere
- **He-3 Valuation** — Current projected price: $3B/ton (pre-infrastructure), but cost drops with lunar operations

## ✍️ Notes

Early-stage energy concept. Feedback welcome on fusion reactor feasibility, lunar mining partnerships, and Earth-to-stratosphere transfer logistics.
