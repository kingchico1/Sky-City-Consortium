# Lunar Helium-3 & Hybrid Buoyancy Systems

Sky City's floatation system proposes a hybrid lift model combining **He-3 gas**, **superheated air**, and **ion stabilization**. This file focuses on the core element: **Helium-3 harvested from lunar regolith.**

## 🚀 Why Helium-3?

Helium-3 (³He) is a rare isotope offering:

- **Low atomic mass** → high lift potential  
- **Non-radioactive** → safer than tritium  
- **Fusion fuel potential** → aligns with future energy scaling

## 🧊 Lift Model Assumptions

| Parameter         | Estimate              |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| He-3 Lift Capacity | ~1.1 kg/m³ at 0.01 atm |
| He-3 Sourcing      | Lunar regolith, 20 ppm |
| Volume Needed      | TBD (see buoyancy model) |

*Initial modeling shows He-3 could reduce platform weight by 8–15% compared to He-4 under same pressure conditions.*

## 🌓 Lunar Mining Concept

- Electrostatic dust separation from regolith  
- Regolith heating >600°C to release trapped He-3  
- Transport via low-gravity tether to orbital depot  
- Loaded into pressurized containment for Earth-bound transfer

---

## ⚡️ Safety + Containment

- Triple-wall pressurized tanks with CNT casing  
- AI-monitored pressure thresholds and leak diagnostics  
- He-3 is non-flammable but still pressure-sensitive
