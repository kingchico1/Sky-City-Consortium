# Carbon Nanotube Panels for Structural Integrity

Sky City's primary platform material will utilize Carbon Nanotube (CNT) composites — chosen for their ultra-high tensile strength, low density, and thermal resilience.

## 🧱 Material Profile

| Property            | Value Range                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Tensile Strength     | Up to 63 GPa                 |
| Density              | ~1.3–1.4 g/cm³               |
| Thermal Conductivity | >3,000 W/m·K                 |
| Electrical Conductivity | Very High                 |
| Flexibility          | High                         |

CNTs outperform steel and titanium on a strength-to-weight basis by orders of magnitude.

## 🧪 Proposed Composition

A layered honeycomb panel structure:
- Outer shell: CNT + Graphene blend
- Core: CNT-reinforced aerogel for insulation
- Embedded mesh: Conductive CNT wiring for sensors and data lines

This structure maintains lift efficiency while withstanding wind shear and micro-meteoroid impacts.

## 🧬 Manufacturing Considerations

- **Sourcing**: Requires access to lunar or orbital carbon harvesting (long-term)
- **Earth-Phase**: Use lab-grown CNTs via CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition)  
- **Layering**: 3D-printed lattice with embedded nano-resin

## 🌐 Functions Beyond Structure

- Heat Dissipation (acts as a radiator layer)  
- Solar Power Conduction (integrates with surface panels)  
- Smart Skin Capable (housing embedded sensors)  
- Radiation Shielding (in CNT-graphene blends)  

---

## 🛠 Prototyping Needs

- Model CNT panel stress under 10–50 km atmospheric pressure  
- Test aerogel-CNT thermal retention at stratospheric lows (-60°C)  
- Simulate micro-impact resistance (high-velocity sand grain analogs)

## 🤝 Call for Contributions

- Submit panel simulation code (OpenFOAM, ANSYS, etc.)  
- Propose new CNT blends for durability vs. cost trade-offs  
- Review feasibility of Earth-based CVD mass production
