# Structural Materials for Sky City

Sky City’s structural integrity depends on materials that are:

- Ultralight
- High tensile strength
- Radiation-resistant
- Temperature-tolerant
- Modular and scalable for replication

---

## 🧬 1. Core Material Candidates

### Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Lattices
- Primary load-bearing skeleton
- Tensile strength: 100× stronger than steel, fraction of the weight
- Integrated with sensors for structural health monitoring (SHM)
- Can be woven into large platform meshes

### CNT + Graphene Hybrid Panels
- For floors, walls, exteriors
- Conductive (useful for energy distribution)
- Radiation shield layers can be embedded
- Semi-flexible for shock absorption

---

## 🪨 2. Lightweight Composites

### Aerogels
- Used for insulation and buoyant structures
- Density as low as 0.03 g/cm³
- Potential CNT-reinforced aerogels under exploration

### Bio-Plastics + Mycelium Composites
- Grown in-situ for internal structures or furniture
- Regenerative, recyclable, low toxicity

---

## ☢️ 3. Environmental Resistance

- UV shielding via embedded nano-coatings
- Anti-oxidative layers prevent CNT degradation
- Surface materials adapted for:
  - -50°C to +60°C ambient fluctuations
  - Ozone layer chemical interactions

---

## 🔄 4. Construction Methodology

- Drone-assisted modular assembly (mid-air or on ocean tethers)
- CNT spooling systems feed material directly into printer arms
- Future additive construction using robotic swarms

---

## 🧪 5. Research Needs

- CNT failure tolerance under wind shear
- Thermal behavior of CNT-graphene-aerogel layers
- Biocompatibility for human habitat interiors
