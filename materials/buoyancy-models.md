# Buoyancy Models and Hybrid Lift Strategies

This document outlines the primary lift mechanisms proposed for Sky City’s stratospheric platforms, integrating classical aerostatics with speculative next-gen propulsion.

## 🎈 Hybrid Buoyancy Components

**1. Heated Air Chambers**  
- Traditional lift via low-density hot air  
- Can be augmented with focused solar heating  
- Adjustable for fine altitude control

**2. Helium/Hydrogen Compartments**  
- High-lift, low-mass gas cells embedded in upper decks  
- Fire suppression tech required for hydrogen variants  
- Modeled after aerostat platforms like Zeppelins

**3. Lunar Helium-3 (He-3) Infusion**  
- Theoretical inclusion to enhance long-term lift (subject to viability)  
- Future potential as fuel source for thermonuclear lift platforms

**4. Ion Stabilization Fields**  
- Active electromagnetic fields to counter turbulence and maintain platform pitch  
- Inspired by research into ionic wind propulsion (see NASA’s X-plane work)

## 📐 Lift-to-Mass Estimates

| Component            | Estimated Lift | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| Heated Air           | 1.0–1.2 kg/m³  | Variable by temperature |
| Helium               | 1.1 kg/m³      | Stable, expensive |
| Hydrogen             | 1.2 kg/m³      | Dangerous, requires containment |
| He-3 Speculative     | TBD            | Under theoretical review |
