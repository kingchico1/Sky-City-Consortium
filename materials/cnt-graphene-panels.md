# CNT–Graphene Composite Panels for Sky City Platforms

Our proposed structural backbone for Sky City relies on carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene-based composites, offering extreme strength-to-weight ratios and radiation resistance.

## ⚙️ Why CNT + Graphene?

| Property                  | Benefit for Sky City                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Ultra-Lightweight         | Essential for buoyant platforms              |
| Tensile Strength >100x Steel | Enables long-span lattices, minimal bulk     |
| High Thermal Conductivity | Reduces overheating in solar zones           |
| Radiation Shielding       | Protects inhabitants at stratospheric altitudes |

## 🧪 Preliminary Material Mix

- **70% Aligned CNT fibers** (vertically, for tensile stress)
- **25% Graphene sheets** (cross-layered for stiffness)
- **5% Aerogel-infused epoxy** (for density reduction)

Target Density: **0.12 g/cm³**  
Compressive Strength: TBD via sim + field testing.
