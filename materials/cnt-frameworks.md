# Carbon Nanotube Frameworks for Sky Cities

Sky City's core structural integrity depends on ultralight yet strong materials. Carbon Nanotube (CNT) frameworks are our foundational approach.

## ðŸ§ª Why CNT?

- **Strength-to-weight ratio:** 50â€“100x stronger than steel at ~1/6th the weight.
- **Thermal stability:** Withstands extreme stratospheric temps and solar radiation.
- **Flexibility:** Ideal for modular lattice structures and expansion phases.

## ðŸ”§ Proposed CNT Composite Blends

| Material Blend             | Function                        | Notes                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CNT + Graphene Mesh        | Load-bearing lattice cores       | Maximizes strength and conductivity |
| CNT + Aerogel Infill       | Buoyant support panels           | Reduces density (<0.1 g/cmÂ³)        |
| CNT + Transparent Polymer  | Dome windows                     | Radiation shielding with clarity    |
