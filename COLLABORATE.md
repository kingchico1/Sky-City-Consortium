# 🤝 Collaborate with Sky City Consortium

Sky City is more than a vision — it's an open-source call to engineers, futurists, architects, scientists, and storytellers to help co-create the world above the clouds.

## ✨ Who We're Looking For

- Aerospace engineers (buoyancy, lift modeling, thrusters)
- AI specialists (load balancing, governance models)
- Sustainability scientists (closed-loop systems, food/water design)
- Materials experts (carbon-nanotubes, ultralight lattice structures)
- Visionary thinkers (post-nation governance, ethics, narrative builders)
- 3D modelers / simulation contributors
- Strategists, grant writers, and consortium builders

## 🧠 How to Get Involved

- Fork the repo and contribute code, models, or documents
- Start a new branch and open a Pull Request (PR)
- Join discussions under Issues or submit a new one
- Reach out via email: **[your_email_here]**
- Or DM on Twitter/X: **[@yourhandle]**

## 🧪 Immediate Areas of Focus

- Buoyancy + helium-lift modeling
- Vertical solar & energy systems (24/7 stratospheric exposure)
- AI governance simulation (consensus engine draft)
- Platform edge safety mechanisms and zone layout maps
- Microclimate control & shielding layers
- Post-nation ethical framework design

## 🧰 Tools We Like

- GitHub for collaboration & versioning
- Blender / Unreal Engine for visual prototypes
- SymPy / NumPy for physics/math simulations
- Figma for systems mapping
- LLMs for drafting/ideation support

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision

We’re laying the groundwork for modular, stratosphere-based civilization platforms that will serve as proofs of concept before Mars colonization. Collaborate today — build the next civilization tomorrow.

> 🚀 "Before we terraform Mars, let’s prove we can build a better world above Earth."
