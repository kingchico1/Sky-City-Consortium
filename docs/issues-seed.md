# ✅ Starter Issues for GitHub Collaboration

These are initial open issues to populate the Sky City Consortium repo and spark contributions from engineers, scientists, and futurists.

## [DISCUSSION] Hybrid Buoyancy Model Contributions

📂 Folder: /buoyancy/

Let’s refine the hybrid lift system. Should we rely more on:
- Superheated air
- Lunar-sourced helium-3
- CNT-structured vacuum cells
- Ion-based stabilization?

What calculations, physics models, or references should we include?

💡 Goal: Populate buoyancy-models.md with 2–3 viable lift strategies and a comparison table.

## [RESEARCH] He-3 Supply Chain Viability

📂 Folder: /energy/

Is Helium-3 a realistic long-term energy source? What missions are exploring it? 
- China’s Chang’e program
- NASA Artemis
- Private lunar mining proposals?

Contribute to he3-analysis.md with citations, maps, or feasibility reports.

Bonus: Suggest near-term energy alternatives (e.g. stratospheric solar farms, hydrogen cells).

## [DESIGN] Platform Sketches & Zoning Prototypes

📂 Folder: /designs/

Have an idea for how a floating city might look?  
Add platform layout sketches — zones for energy, farming, living, recycling, etc.

Upload concepts to platform-sketches.md or /assets/. Low-fidelity drawings welcome!

🧩 Bonus: Suggest how modular expansion could work over time.

## [ETHICS] What is Post-Nation Governance?

📂 Folder: /governance/

If Sky City isn’t tied to a country — who governs it?

Help define models:
- Decentralized voting systems
- AI + human hybrid governance
- Merit-based roles and residency

📜 Add your proposal to governance-models.md or start a debate thread in Issues.

## [HELP WANTED] First Simulation Script (Python or Math)

📂 Folder: /simulations/

Seed the simulations folder with a basic model:
- Lift vs. altitude curve
- Solar input at 20km
- He-3 decay models
- Resource flow diagrams

Upload a .py or .ipynb file or link to a GitHub Gist.

🛠️ Let’s get something visual and useful into the repo to inspire developers.
