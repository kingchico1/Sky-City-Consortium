# Sky-City Consortium: Project Overview

An open-source blueprint for a stratospheric aerial civilization.  
This is a collaborative, research-first vision to create a floating post-nation city in Earth's upper atmosphere.

---

## 🎯 Vision
To build a modular, sustainable city that floats above borders — engineered for peace, innovation, and environmental harmony.

---

## 🌐 Inspirations
- **Laputa** (from *Castle in the Sky*)
- **O’Neill Cylinders** and orbital habitats
- **Floating blockchain nations** and stateless models
- High-altitude research balloons and dirigibles
- Environmental reclamation and air-based agriculture

---

## 🔧 Early Concept Pillars
- Anti-gravity or aerostat-based structures  
- Cloud water harvesting and solar energy systems  
- Modular residential and research hubs  
- Circular economy infrastructure  
- AI-assisted governance models
