# Atmospheric Structure Concept

A concept for a multi-tiered aerial city that floats using advanced aerostat technologies, solar lift, or buoyant gas frameworks.

## Proposed Layers
- **Layer 1: Buoyancy Deck**  
  Housing helium or heated-air systems, energy collectors.

- **Layer 2: Living Quarters**  
  Rotating habitation rings with artificial gravity via spin.

- **Layer 3: Research Deck**  
  Labs, observatories, aerial farm modules.

## Challenges
- Sustaining buoyancy over time  
- Safe descent/emergency protocols  
- Weather resistance and shielding
