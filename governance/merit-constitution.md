# The Merit Constitution – Sky City's Post-Nation Governance Model

Sky City is a sovereign floating platform above the Earth—detached from national borders, politics, and historical power dynamics. Governance is built on **merit**, **stewardship**, and **AI-assisted consensus**, not inherited power or political parties.

---

## 👑 1. Foundational Principles

- No inherited authority — access to influence is earned, not granted
- Decisions made via reputation-weighted consensus, not majority vote
- Citizens earn governance privileges through transparent contributions (research, engineering, policy drafts, etc.)
- AI assists in summarizing debates, not in making decisions

---

## 🌐 2. Citizenship Tiers

| Tier | How Earned | Rights |
|------|------------|--------|
| Resident | Minimum contribution (code, design, discussion) | Vote on non-critical issues |
| Steward | Peer-voted contributor with reputation | Propose major protocols, moderate debates |
| Architect | Foundational contributor with history | Veto power, initiate forks, governance anchors |

- **All citizenship is revocable** through transparent review
- No permanent class—only continuous contribution sustains position

---

## 🤖 3. AI Consensus Engines

- AI aggregates discussions (e.g., debates on solar usage, ethics)
- Large language models used for:
  - Summarizing forum debates
  - Mapping stakeholder sentiment
  - Suggesting compromise language
- Final decisions made by qualified human nodes

---

## 🌱 4. Ethical Framework

- Long-term stewardship of the stratosphere
- No ecological harm to Earth's surface below
- Open science, radical transparency, collective ownership of knowledge
- Respect for cultural diversity while avoiding nationalism

---

## 🗳️ 5. Contribution-Based Governance

- Every GitHub PR, whitepaper, or simulation reviewed counts as a political act
- More meaningful the contribution, higher the influence
- This removes the influence of money or traditional lobbying

---

## 🧪 Future Exploration

- How do we handle dissent or misinformation in a floating society?
- How does identity verification work without nations?
- Can citizens opt into AI co-governors as a personal political assistant?
