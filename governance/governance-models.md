# Governance Models for Sky City

Sky City is not a nation-state.  
It is a **civilizational prototype** above Earth — a post-national habitat governed by principles of merit, contribution, and long-term stewardship.

---

## 🧠 1. Foundational Principles

- **Merit-Based Participation**  
  Access and influence are earned through contribution (scientific, operational, creative).
  
- **Rotating Stewardship**  
  Key leadership roles rotate quarterly or annually based on impact metrics and peer voting.

- **AI-Guided Consensus**  
  AI mediators analyze proposals, surface collective sentiment, and flag ethical concerns using transparent models (explainable AI).

## 🏛️ 2. Decision-Making Structure

| Role | Selection | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Stewards Council | Elected by contributors | Guides platform-wide policies |
| Domain Leads (e.g., Energy, Biozone) | By PR count + peer nomination | Oversees technical progress |
| Ethos Committee | Randomly rotated | Ensures ethical alignment |
| AI Governance Engine | Auditable model | Flags conflicts, simulates outcomes |

## 🛡️ 3. Rights and Access

- No "citizenship" in the traditional sense
- Levels of access based on:
  - Knowledge contribution (pull requests)
  - Problem-solving involvement (issue participation)
  - Constructive governance input (votes, proposals)

---

## 🌐 4. Cross-Civilizational Links

- Sky City operates *above* existing jurisdictions
- Engages with Earth nations via treaties (like ISS model)
- Charter aligned with planetary sustainability and universal human rights

---

## 🤝 5. Open Questions (for collaboration)

- Should we allow economic transactions on Sky City?
- How do we prevent oligarchy in merit systems?
- Can AI-mediated stewardship evolve into spiritual/ethical guardianship?
