# AI Consensus Engine for Sky City Governance

In Sky City, decision-making is supported by an AI-powered consensus engine that aids in evaluating proposals, preventing bias, and ensuring system-wide alignment.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Reduce human bias in policy decisions  
- Detect contradictions in long-term sustainability strategies  
- Offer simulated outcomes for major governance proposals  
- Ensure balance between efficiency, fairness, and ethics

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

| Component           | Role                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Logic Validator      | Runs simulations to assess proposals |
| Bias Detector        | Flags concentration of influence     |
| Memory Archive       | Stores all previous decisions + reasons |
| Consensus Tracker    | Measures public sentiment + DAO input |
| Ethics Filter        | Checks proposals against Sky City’s values |

## 🧪 Simulation Use Cases

- **Resource allocation shifts** (e.g., redirecting solar power)  
- **Adding/removing citizenship tiers**  
- **Emergency lockdown scenarios**  
- **Terraforming or bio-intervention policies**  

---

## 🕊 Checks & Balances

- AI cannot enact policy—only recommend  
- All actions require multi-sig approval from elected Stewards  
- AI logs are public and immutable  
- Manual override protocols exist in `/emergency-systems/`

---

## 🔐 Anti-Corruption Framework

- All inputs logged and reviewed on-chain  
- AI source models are open-source and audit-ready  
- Contributors can challenge AI verdicts via `/governance/disputes.md`

---

## 🤖 Future Considerations

- Should AI agents eventually hold “Observer” status?  
- Should the engine adapt through reinforcement learning or remain static?  
- Who governs the AI?
