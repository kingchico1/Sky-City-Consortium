# Post-Nation Governance & Ethical Frameworks

This document outlines governance principles, merit systems, and philosophical structures designed for a stratospheric civilization operating outside traditional nation-state models.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- **Merit-Based Citizenship** — Rights and responsibilities earned through contribution (technical, educational, service, etc.)
- **Decentralized AI Governance** — AI systems assist decision-making, but final authority rests with human councils
- **Peaceful Neutrality** — Sky City shall not participate in national wars, espionage, or territorial politics
- **Ethical Resource Use** — Transparent management of energy, airspace, and rare materials like He-3

---

## 🌍 Rights and Structures

- **Digital Citizenship** — Residents maintain Earth nationality but gain Sky-City privileges
- **Tiered Access** — Access to power, space, and decision-making based on service and contribution
- **Conflict Mediation** — Trained AI + human council for resolving disputes
- **Open Data** — Governance algorithms, decisions, and infrastructure budgets published openly

---

## 🚀 Experimental Ideas

- **Reputation-Led Democracy** — Reputation score influences voting weight, verified by proof-of-work (not social credit)
- **Guilds & Domains** — Citizens self-organize by profession (e.g., engineers, artists, healers), each with internal systems

## Notes

Early ideas only — collaborators welcome to challenge or evolve this structure.
