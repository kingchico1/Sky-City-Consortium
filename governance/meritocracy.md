# Meritocratic Governance in Sky City

Sky City operates under a post-nation, merit-based governance model designed for scalability, transparency, and long-term stability above Earth’s surface.

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **No Birthright Authority** – Citizenship must be earned, not inherited  
2. **Rotational Stewardship** – Governance roles are time-bound and audited  
3. **AI-Verified Credentials** – Contribution history tracked via on-chain reputations  
4. **Ethical Engineering Mandate** – Every policy must undergo simulation impact review

## 🌐 Citizenship Structure

| Tier             | Access Rights | Criteria                          |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Observer         | Read-only     | Public access                      |
| Contributor      | Edit/propose  | Documented work or PRs             |
| Resident Builder | Vote-enabled  | Min. 12-month contribution cycle   |
| Steward          | Policy power  | Elected via DAO or rep system      |

## 🛠 Governance Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Enforce access + voting transparently  
- **Consensus Engine**: AI aids in preventing bias or stagnation  
- **Public Ledger**: Immutable log of decisions + resource flows

## 💬 Open Questions

- [ ] What qualifies as a "merit-worthy" contribution?  
- [ ] Should stewards be capped per domain (e.g., energy, life support)?  
- [ ] Emergency override protocols?  
- [ ] Should AI agents have “observer” status in debates?
