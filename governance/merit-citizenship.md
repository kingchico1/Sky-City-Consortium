# Merit-Based Citizenship Model for Sky City

Sky City is designed as a post-nation civilization. Instead of borders, it operates on a meritocratic, contribution-based access system — aiming to avoid elitism while rewarding value creation.

## 🧭 Key Principles

- **Earned Access**: Citizenship is gained through contribution — not inheritance or wealth alone.
- **Fluid Roles**: Citizens may shift between roles (research, agriculture, security) as needs evolve.
- **Global Equity**: Residency is not tied to nationality or passport. Identity is reputation-driven.

## 🛠 How It Works

| Level         | Criteria                                 | Rights Granted                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Observer      | Anyone; read-only access to systems      | View data, limited movement                |
| Contributor   | Commits code, research, energy, etc.     | Workspace access, shared credits           |
| Citizen       | Long-term impact (governance votes, builds) | Housing rights, voting, resource allocation |

## 🗳 Governance Rotation

- AI-assisted consensus engine cycles citizen leaders every 6–12 months.
- Transparent voting protocols based on verified contributions.
- Rotating councils by field (Science, Ethics, Engineering, etc.)

## 🔍 Ethical Questions

- How do we prevent abuse or gatekeeping?
- What safeguards protect dissent and innovation?
- Can we blend AI judgment with human empathy?
