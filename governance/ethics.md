# Ethical Frameworks for Sky City Civilization

Sky City is more than an engineering feat — it is a social experiment. This file outlines the core ethical principles guiding life, governance, and decision-making within aerial cities.

## 🌍 Post-National Ethics

- **Merit-Based Citizenship** — Contributions to science, design, community, or peace-building outweigh passports.
- **No Birthright Dominance** — Citizenship is earned, not inherited — rotation and renewal encouraged.
- **Civic Contributions** — Clean energy input, urban gardening, or design proposals count as civic value.

## 🧬 Bioethics & Tech

- **No Exploitation of Human Genetics** — AI, CRISPR, and bioenhancement must be governed by global ethical standards.
- **Surveillance with Consent** — Smart systems are transparent, opt-in, and protect civil liberties.

---

## 🛡️ Conflict & Power

- **No Military Sovereignty** — Sky Cities will not harbor weaponized forces or national defense posts.
- **Council Rotation** — Leadership governed by rotating councils, AI advisory boards, and blind peer voting.
- **Whistleblower Protections** — Clear systems to report abuse, discrimination, or hidden monopolies.

## 🧠 Philosophy of Freedom
