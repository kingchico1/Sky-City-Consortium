# Platform Sketches and Structural Concepts

This file contains conceptual and technical sketches for Sky City platforms ranging from 1 km prototypes to full 10–50 km floating cities.

## 📐 Core Design Goals

- **Scalability** – Modular segments that allow growth over time
- **Weight Efficiency** – Use of CNT frameworks, aerogels, and lightweight composites
- **Buoyancy Integration** – Compatibility with hybrid lift systems (He-3, heated air, ion stabilization)
- **Multi-Zone Layouts** – Residential, agricultural, governance, and energy zones
- **Safety & Redundancy** – Multiple support layers, emergency floatation failsafes

## 🧠 Conceptual Layouts

- **Spoke-Hub Design** – Central control + rotating residential zones  
- **Hexagonal Modules** – Inspired by honeycomb lattice for strength  
- **Ring Perimeters** – For wind shear mitigation and solar harvesting  
- **Sub-Deck Buoyancy Pods** – Distributed under the structure, with variable thrust controls

## 📎 Notes

- Early-stage drafts welcome. Diagrams can be placed in `/assets/` folder.
- PRs encouraged for CAD files, visual models, or math-based simulations.
